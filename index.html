        <p>This website was made by Lachlan Row in 2019 for the NCEA level 1 achievement standard 91880, based around creating a media outcome. This site is my outcome, and uses the following techniques.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Styling to make a sticky topbar, with links to other pages that change colour if they are active or being hovered over</li>
            <li>Importing a number of fonts from an external folder in .otf formats and using them in various parts of my website in positions fitting of the style of the fonts</li>
            <li>Using borders, margins and padding to succesfully position divs where I want them on the screen, even when the view port size is changed.</li>
            <li>Linked videos from youtube to the site and linked them to the theme</li>
            <li>Given images borders and subtitles, allowing users to more fully understand the contect of the images</li>
            <li>Created a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing theme for the website, fitting for it's content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also attempted to include a scrolling sidebar with the sticky attribute as well, but I could not figure it our after a solid week of attempts, and so decided to leave it out.
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope you enjoy this website, and appreciate the effort I have put into it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Cheers,
        <br>
